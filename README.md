# XLB: A Differentiable Massively Parallel Lattice Boltzmann Library in Python for Physics-Based Machine Learning

üéâ **Exciting News!** üéâ XLB version 0.2.0 has been released, featuring a complete rewrite of the library and introducing support for the NVIDIA Warp backend! 
XLB can now be installed via pip: `pip install xlb`.

XLB is a fully differentiable 2D/3D Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) library that leverages hardware acceleration. It supports [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and [NVIDIA Warp](https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp) backends, and is specifically designed to solve fluid dynamics problems in a computationally efficient and differentiable manner. Its unique combination of features positions it as an exceptionally suitable tool for applications in physics-based machine learning. With the new Warp backend, XLB now offers state-of-the-art performance for even faster simulations.

## Getting Started
To get started with XLB, you can install it using pip. There are different installation options depending on your hardware and needs:

### Basic Installation (CPU-only)
```bash
pip install xlb
```

### Installation with CUDA support (for NVIDIA GPUs)
This installation is for the JAX backend with CUDA support:
```bash
pip install "xlb[cuda]"
```

### Installation with TPU support
This installation is for the JAX backend with TPU support:
```bash
pip install "xlb[tpu]"
```

### Notes:
- For Mac users: Use the basic CPU installation command as JAX's GPU support is not available on MacOS
- The NVIDIA Warp backend is included in all installation options and supports CUDA automatically when available
- The installation options for CUDA and TPU only affect the JAX backend

To install the latest development version from source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Autodesk/XLB.git
```

The changelog for the releases can be found [here](https://github.com/Autodesk/XLB/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Key Features
- **Multiple Backend Support:** XLB now includes support for multiple backends including JAX and NVIDIA Warp, providing *state-of-the-art* performance for lattice Boltzmann simulations. Currently, only single GPU is supported for the Warp backend.
- **Integration with JAX Ecosystem:** The library can be easily integrated with JAX's robust ecosystem of machine learning libraries such as [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax), [Haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku), [Optax](https://github.com/deepmind/optax), and many more.
- **Differentiable LBM Kernels:** XLB provides differentiable LBM kernels that can be used in differentiable physics and deep learning applications.
- **Scalability:** XLB is capable of scaling on distributed multi-GPU systems using the JAX backend, enabling the execution of large-scale simulations on hundreds of GPUs with billions of cells.
- **Support for Various LBM Boundary Conditions and Kernels:** XLB supports several LBM boundary conditions and collision kernels.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Written entirely in Python, XLB emphasizes a highly accessible interface that allows users to extend the library with ease and quickly set up and run new simulations.
- **Leverages JAX Array and Shardmap:** The library incorporates the new JAX array unified array type and JAX shardmap, providing users with a numpy-like interface. This allows users to focus solely on the semantics, leaving performance optimizations to the compiler.
- **Platform Versatility:** The same XLB code can be executed on a variety of platforms including multi-core CPUs, single or multi-GPU systems, TPUs, and it also supports distributed runs on multi-GPU systems or TPU Pod slices.
- **Visualization:** XLB provides a variety of visualization options including in-situ on GPU rendering using [PhantomGaze](https://github.com/loliverhennigh/PhantomGaze).

### Boundary conditions

- **Equilibrium BC:** In this boundary condition, the fluid populations are assumed to be in at equilibrium. Can be used to set prescribed velocity or pressure.

- **Full-Way Bounceback BC:** In this boundary condition, the velocity of the fluid populations is reflected back to the fluid side of the boundary, resulting in zero fluid velocity at the boundary.

- **Half-Way Bounceback BC:** Similar to the Full-Way Bounceback BC, in this boundary condition, the velocity of the fluid populations is partially reflected back to the fluid side of the boundary, resulting in a non-zero fluid velocity at the boundary.

- **Do Nothing BC:** In this boundary condition, the fluid populations are allowed to pass through the boundary without any reflection or modification.

- **Zouhe BC:** This boundary condition is used to impose a prescribed velocity or pressure profile at the boundary.
- **Regularized BC:** This boundary condition is used to impose a prescribed velocity or pressure profile at the boundary. This BC is more stable than Zouhe BC, but computationally more expensive.
- **Extrapolation Outflow BC:** A type of outflow boundary condition that uses extrapolation to avoid strong wave reflections.

- **Interpolated Bounceback BC:** Interpolated bounce-back boundary condition for representing curved boundaries.
