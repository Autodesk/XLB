ðŸŽ‰ **Exciting News!**  
XLB version 0.2.0 has been released, featuring a complete rewrite of the library and introducing support for the NVIDIA Warp backend!  
XLB can now be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install xlb
```

# XLB: Differentiable Lattice Boltzmann Library

**XLB** is a fully differentiable 2D/3D Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) library that leverages hardware acceleration.  
XLB supports [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and [NVIDIA Warp](https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp) backends,  
and is specifically designed to solve fluid dynamics problems in a computationally efficient and differentiable manner.  
Its unique combination of features positions it as an exceptionally suitable tool for applications in physics-based machine learning.  
With the new Warp backend, XLB now offers state-of-the-art performance for even faster simulations.

# Key Features

- **Multiple Backend Support:** XLB now includes support for multiple backends including JAX and NVIDIA Warp, providing *state-of-the-art* performance for lattice Boltzmann simulations. Currently, only single GPU is supported for the Warp backend.
- **Integration with JAX Ecosystem:** The library can be easily integrated with JAX's robust ecosystem of machine learning libraries such as [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax), [Haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku), [Optax](https://github.com/deepmind/optax), and many more.
- **Differentiable LBM Kernels:** XLB provides differentiable LBM kernels that can be used in differentiable physics and deep learning applications.
- **Scalability:** XLB is capable of scaling on distributed multi-GPU systems using the JAX backend, enabling the execution of large-scale simulations on hundreds of GPUs with billions of cells.
- **Support for Various LBM Boundary Conditions and Kernels:** XLB supports several LBM boundary conditions and collision kernels.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Written entirely in Python, XLB emphasizes a highly accessible interface that allows users to extend the library with ease and quickly set up and run new simulations.
- **Leverages JAX Array and Shardmap:** The library incorporates the new JAX array unified array type and JAX shardmap, providing users with a numpy-like interface. This allows users to focus solely on the semantics, leaving performance optimizations to the compiler.
- **Platform Versatility:** The same XLB code can be executed on a variety of platforms including multi-core CPUs, single or multi-GPU systems, TPUs, and it also supports distributed runs on multi-GPU systems or TPU Pod slices.
- **Visualization:** XLB provides a variety of visualization options including in-situ on GPU rendering using [PhantomGaze](https://github.com/loliverhennigh/PhantomGaze).

# Capabilities

- Out-of-core support *(coming soon)*  

## Output

- Binary and ASCII VTK output (based on PyVista library)  
- In-situ rendering using [PhantomGaze](https://github.com/loliverhennigh/PhantomGaze) library  
- [Orbax](https://github.com/google/orbax)-based distributed asynchronous checkpointing  
- Image Output  
- 3D mesh voxelizer using `trimesh`

## Boundary Conditions

- **Equilibrium BC:** In this boundary condition, the fluid populations are assumed to be at equilibrium. Can be used to set prescribed velocity or pressure.  
- **Full-Way Bounceback BC:** The velocity of the fluid populations is reflected back to the fluid side of the boundary, resulting in zero fluid velocity at the boundary.  
- **Half-Way Bounceback BC:** The velocity of the fluid populations is partially reflected back, resulting in a non-zero fluid velocity at the boundary.  
- **Do Nothing BC:** The fluid populations are allowed to pass through the boundary without any reflection or modification.  
- **Zouhe BC:** Used to impose a prescribed velocity or pressure profile at the boundary.  
- **Regularized BC:** More stable than Zouhe BC, but computationally more expensive.  
- **Extrapolation Outflow BC:** A type of outflow boundary condition that uses extrapolation to avoid strong wave reflections.  
- **Interpolated Bounceback BC:** Interpolated bounce-back boundary condition for representing curved boundaries.
