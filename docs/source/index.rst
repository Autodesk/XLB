ðŸŽ‰ **Exciting News!** ðŸŽ‰ 
XLB version 0.2.0 has been released, featuring a complete rewrite of the library and introducing support for the NVIDIA Warp backend! 
XLB can now be installed via pip: `pip install xlb`.

XLB is a fully differentiable 2D/3D Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) library that leverages hardware acceleration. 
XLB supports `JAX <https://github.com/google/jax>`_ and `NVIDIA Warp <https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp>`_ backends,
and is specifically designed to solve fluid dynamics problems in a computationally efficient and differentiable manner. 
Its unique combination of features positions it as an exceptionally suitable tool for applications in physics-based machine learning. 
With the new Warp backend, XLB now offers state-of-the-art performance for even faster simulations.

Key Features
============

- **Multiple Backend Support:** XLB now includes support for multiple backends including JAX and NVIDIA Warp, providing *state-of-the-art* performance for lattice Boltzmann simulations. Currently, only single GPU is supported for the Warp backend.
- **Integration with JAX Ecosystem:** The library can be easily integrated with JAX's robust ecosystem of machine learning libraries such as `Flax <https://github.com/google/flax>`_, `Haiku <https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku>`_, `Optax <https://github.com/deepmind/optax>`_, and many more.
- **Differentiable LBM Kernels:** XLB provides differentiable LBM kernels that can be used in differentiable physics and deep learning applications.
- **Scalability:** XLB is capable of scaling on distributed multi-GPU systems using the JAX backend, enabling the execution of large-scale simulations on hundreds of GPUs with billions of cells.
- **Support for Various LBM Boundary Conditions and Kernels:** XLB supports several LBM boundary conditions and collision kernels.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Written entirely in Python, XLB emphasizes a highly accessible interface that allows users to extend the library with ease and quickly set up and run new simulations.
- **Leverages JAX Array and Shardmap:** The library incorporates the new JAX array unified array type and JAX shardmap, providing users with a numpy-like interface. This allows users to focus solely on the semantics, leaving performance optimizations to the compiler.
- **Platform Versatility:** The same XLB code can be executed on a variety of platforms including multi-core CPUs, single or multi-GPU systems, TPUs, and it also supports distributed runs on multi-GPU systems or TPU Pod slices.
- **Visualization:** XLB provides a variety of visualization options including in-situ on GPU rendering using `PhantomGaze <https://github.com/loliverhennigh/PhantomGaze>`_.

Boundary Conditions
-------------------

- **Equilibrium BC:** In this boundary condition, the fluid populations are assumed to be at equilibrium. Can be used to set prescribed velocity or pressure.
- **Full-Way Bounceback BC:** The velocity of the fluid populations is reflected back to the fluid side of the boundary, resulting in zero fluid velocity at the boundary.
- **Half-Way Bounceback BC:** The velocity of the fluid populations is partially reflected back, resulting in a non-zero fluid velocity at the boundary.
- **Do Nothing BC:** The fluid populations are allowed to pass through the boundary without any reflection or modification.
- **Zouhe BC:** Used to impose a prescribed velocity or pressure profile at the boundary.
- **Regularized BC:** More stable than Zouhe BC, but computationally more expensive.
- **Extrapolation Outflow BC:** A type of outflow boundary condition that uses extrapolation to avoid strong wave reflections.
- **Interpolated Bounceback BC:** Interpolated bounce-back boundary condition for representing curved boundaries.
