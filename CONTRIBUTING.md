# XLB's Community and How to Contribute

The XLB team is deeply committed to the ethos of open-source. We are always open to, and greatly value, contributions from our community, which can take the form of suggesting new features, reporting issues, and contributing code. This document will guide you through the various processes you can follow to contribute to our project.

## Providing Suggestions

We believe that XLB should continually evolve in response to community feedback. As such, we highly value your suggestions on how to enhance the design or functionality of our platform. Please use the enhancement tag when submitting issues that are specifically suggestions, as this will help us categorize and respond appropriately.

## Filing Bugs

Despite our best efforts, like any software, XLB may occasionally have bugs. If you encounter any, please report them as regular issues on our GitHub page. We are continuously monitoring these issues, and we will prioritize and schedule fixes accordingly.

The most effective bug reports provide a detailed method for reliably reproducing the issue and, if possible, a working example demonstrating the problem.

## Contributing Code

Contributing your code to our project involves three main steps: signing a Contributor License Agreement, discussing your goals with the community, adhering to XLB's coding standards when writing your code, and finally, submitting a pull request.


### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before you can contribute any code to this project, we kindly request you to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). We are unable to accept any pull request without a signed CLA.

- If you are contributing as an individual, the process of signing the CLA is integrated into the pull request procedure.

- If you are contributing on behalf of your employer, please sign our [**Corporate Contributor License Agreement**](https://github.com/Autodesk/autodesk.github.io/releases/download/1.0/ADSK.Form.Corp.Contrib.Agmt.for.Open.Source.docx). The document includes instructions on where to send the completed forms to. Once a signed form has been received, we can happily review and accept your pull requests.

### Coordinate With the Community

We strongly advise that you initiate your contribution process by opening an issue on GitHub to outline your objectives prior to beginning any coding. This proactive approach facilitates early feedback from the community and helps prevent potential overlaps in contributions.

### Git Workflow

We follow the [GitFlow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) development model. 
If you would like to contribute your code to XLB, you should:
- Include your work in a feature branch created from the XLB `main` branch. The `main` branch contains the latest work in XLB. 
- Then, create a pull request against the `main` branch.


When you submit your code, please include relevant tests as part of the pull request, and ensure that your comments and coding style align with the rest of the project. You can refer to the existing code for examples of the testing and style practices that the project follows.
